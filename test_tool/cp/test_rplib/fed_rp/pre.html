<h1>User Manual</h1>

This tool that can be used to test OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation
aware RP library have several different interfaces.
Each one presenting part of the necessary functionality.

<h3>Federation operator</h3>
<p>
    The tool can act as several federation operators. What this
    means is that you can request that the tool signed a statement you
    presents it with as if the tool represented a federation operator.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>The syntax is</dt>
    <dd><i>base_url</i>/sign?signer=fo_identifier</dd>
</dl>

<b>Note:</b> <i>base_url</i> being the base URL for the test tool.
For this instance <i>base_url</i>={base_url} <br>
<i>base_url</i> will not be used in the examples but will be in the active links
below.

<p>
    For instance:
    <br>
<pre><code>
    POST /sign?signer=https%3A%2F%2Fswamid.sunet.se HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    { "redirect_uris": [ "https://www.example.org" ]}
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
    To find out which federation operators the tool can act as,
    send this command:
    <br>
<pre><code>
    GET /who
    Host: server.example.com

</code></pre>
</p>
It will return a list of URLs each one an identifier for a
federation operator.

<h3>Federation keys</h3>

Each federation will have keys it can use to sign metadata statements
with. You can get all the necessary validation keys from
the tool. To get them you need to use another command:
<pre><code>
    GET /bundle
    Host: server.example.com
</code></pre>
<p>
    If you do GET /bundle you will get a signed JWT containing a
    JSON document with all the public keys.
    The format of the bundle is:
</p>
<pre><code>
    {&lt;FO1 identifier&gt;: JWKS, ... , &lt;FOn identifier&gt;: JWKS}
</code></pre>

The format of a JWKS is defined in RFC 7517.
<p>
    Now you don't have the key to verify the signature of the bundle.
    But don't despair, you can get that too from the tool.<br>
    Now in real life you would not do it like this, but for our testing
    it is sufficient.
</p>
To get the signing key issue:

<pre><code>
    GET /bundle/sigkey
    Host: Server.example.com
</code></pre>

This command will return a JWKS containing the public part of the signing key.

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<h4> Find which federations are around </h4>

<a href="{base_url}who">/who</a>

<h4>Sign a metadata statement</h4>
<p>
    Construct a metadata statement and place it in a file. Once
    you have it in a file and if you have <em>curl</em> on your machine
    you can do (assuming the metadata statement file is named <i>ms.json</i>):
</p>
<pre><code>
    $ curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @ms.json {base_url}/sign?signer=https%3A%2F%2Fswamid.sunet.se
</code></pre>

<h4>Verifying a metadata statement signed by a FO</h4>
<p>
    To do this you need the signing key of the FO
</p>
<p>
    Assuming your federation you used was SWAMID then you can get just that
    Federation
    operators key by doing.
</p>
<a href="{base_url}bundle?iss=https%3A%2F%2Fswamid.sunet.se">{base_url}bundle?iss=https%3A%2F%2Fswamid.sunet.se</a>
<br>
You can just fetch all the Federation Operators keys know to the test toll
by clicking on:
<a href="{base_url}bundle">{base_url}bundle</a>
<br>
Which ever of these you chose to do is should lead to you now having a file
called 'bundle' in your download directory.
This bundle (a signed JWT) is signed by the tools signing key.
Which you then have to fetch here:
<a href="{base_url}bundle/sigkey">{base_url}bundle/sigkey</a>
<h4>Dealing with Provider info discovery</h4>
In the descriptions of the tests I use level 0/1/2 metadata statements.
What it means is that for
<dl>
    <dt>Level 0</dt>
    <dd>the OP's metadata statement is signed directly by the Federation
        operator.
    </dd>
    <dt>Level 1</dt>
    <dd>the OP's metadata statement is signed by an organisation, so we have the
        chain OP-Organisation-FO
    </dd>
    <dt>Level 2</dt>
    <dd>
        the OP's metadata statement is signed by an intermediate agent which
        gives the chain OP-IA-Organisation-FO or to be really correct in our
        case
        OP-Organisation-FO1-FO2.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h5>Step 1, how do you get the provider info ?</h5>

You construct a URL using this pattern:<br>
<i>base_url</i>/{tester_id}/{test_id}/.well-known/openid-configuration <br>

<dl>
    <dt>tester_id</dt>
    <dd>Is something you chose as your identifier. It is the name
    of the log directory where the test tools logs on what happen between
    you and it appears</dd>
    <dt>test_id</dt>
    <dd>This is the test ID that appears in the table above</dd>
</dl>

An example on what it may look like:
<pre><code>
    $ curl -k {base_url}foo/rp-sms-single-l1/.well-known/openid-configuration
</code></pre>
here <i>foo</i> is the <b>tester_id</b> and <i>rp-sms-single-l1</i> is the <b>test_id</b>
<br>
As response you should get a JSON document.

<h5>Step 2 registering a client</h5>

When you have done the provider info discovery as described above you find the
registration_endpoint in the JSON document. It should be: <br>

<code> {base_url}foo/rp-sms-single-l1/registration </code>

<br>
When you have constructed your registration request this is where you must send
the request.
<br>
<b><i>Note</i></b> that different tests will provide different registration_endpoints
since the URL contains the <b>tester_id</b> and the <b>test_id</b>.

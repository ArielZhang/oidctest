<h1>User Manual</h1>

This tool that can be used to test OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation
aware RP library have several different interfaces.
Each one presenting part of the necessary functionality.

<h3>Federation operator</h3>
<p>
The tool can act as several federation operators. What this
means is that you can request that the tool signed a statement you
presents it with as if the tool represented a federation operator.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>The syntax is</dt>
    <dd><i>base_url</i>/sign?signer=fo_identifier</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For instance:
<br>
    <pre>
<code>
    POST /sign?signer=https%3A%2F%2Fswamid.sunet.se HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    { "redirect_uris": [ "https://www.example.org" ]}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
To find out which federation operators the tool can act as
send this command:
    <br>
<pre><code>
    GET /who
    Host: server.example.com

</code></pre>
</p>
It will return a list of URLs each one an identifier for a
federation operator.

<h3>Federation keys</h3>

Each federation will have keys it can use to sign metadata statements
with. You can get all the necessary validation keys from
the tool. To get them you need to use another command:
<pre><code>
    GET /bundle
    Host: server.example.com
</code></pre>
<p>
If you do GET /bundle you will get a signed JWT containing a
JSON document with all the public keys.
The format of the bundle is:
</p>
<pre><code>
    {&lt;FO1 identifier&gt;: JWKS, ... , &lt;FOn identifier&gt;: JWKS}
</code></pre>

The format of a JWKS is defined in RFC 7517.
<p>
Now you don't have the key to verify the signature of the bundle.
But don't despair, you can get that too from the tool.
Now in real life you would not do it like this, but for our testing
it is sufficient.
</p>
To get the signing key issue:

<pre><code>
    GET /bundle/sigkey
    Host: Server.example.com
</code></pre>

This command will return a JWKS containing the public part of the signing key.

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<h4> Find which federations are around </h4>

<a href="{base_url}/who">/who</a>

<h4>Sign a metadata statement</h4>
<p>
    Construct a metadata statement and place it in a file. Once
    you have it in a file and if you have <em>curl</em> on your machine
    you can do (assuming the metadata statement file is named <i>ms.json</i>):
</p>
<pre><code>
    $ curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @ms.json {base_url}/sign?signer=https%3A%2F%2Fsunet.se
</code></pre>

<h4>Verifying a metadata statement signed by a FO</h4>
<p>
    To do this you need the signing key of the FO
